# Airin 4 Chat Server Daemon #
A stable, fast and secure websocket-based chat daemon written in C++ with Qt framework.

## Installation
To install and use Airin you need to build it. Airin is made with Qt, so the easiest way is to download [Qt SDK](https://www.qt.io/download-qt-installer "Qt SDK") and build it using Qt Creator. Binary packages will be provided later.

After that you need to set up your database. Currently Airin is maintained for PostgreSQL, but it can be used with MySQL. Just import the SQL file ([PostgreSQL](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asterleen/airin/master/dist/airin.pg.sql "PostgreSQL"), MySQL), set up privileges and that's it!

## Configuration
To configure Airin please read [this Wiki page](https://github.com/asterleen/airin/wiki/Configuration "this Wiki page").

## Airin loves you :3
